Hi!  
Here is my report. All research is in *research.ipynb*. Research is structured, you can find MarkDown titles and navigate through them. 

The results are in the end. But I wrote notes within the whole notebook, check it if it's interesting. 

HTML files are interactive visualizations with plotly. You can find their description closer to the end of the notebook.

I haven't done Task 3 at all, because I spent too much time on research and different LMs.  
So, yeah, I'm sorry for this. It's not difficult but it would take a lot of time. And there is no Data Scientist who loves Docker :))
